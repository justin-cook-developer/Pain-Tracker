The purpose of this project is to develop a fullstack application using react and redux on the front-end, with express and postgres on the back-end. I also utilized bulma css, sequelize, and set up my first webpack configuration.

To run this project, do the following in your terminal:
  - git clone this project
  - cd redux-pain-log;
  - npm install;
  - create a database named: 'painLog'
  - npm start;
  - Go to your browser, and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

Project usage:
This project is meant to be a notebook of sorts for tracking pain levels over time.
Currently, the profile, login, and sign-up buttons are not functional. They exist purely for decoration at this point in time.
