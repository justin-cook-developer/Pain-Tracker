The purpose of this project is to develop a front-end application using redux and redux-thunk. On the back-end, I used JSON Server to simulate a database with the necessary routing. I also utilized Bulma CSS and set up my first webpack configuration.

To run this project, do the following in your terminal:
  - git clone this project
  - cd redux-pain-log;
  - npm install;
  - npm start;
  - Go to your browser, and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

Project usage:
This project is meant to be a notebook of sorts for tracking pain levels over time.
Currently, the single record, login, and sign-up buttons are not functional. They exist purely for decoration.
