The purpose of this project is to develop a fullstack application using react and redux on the front-end, with express and postgres on the back-end. I also utilized bulma css, sequelize, and set up my first webpack configuration.

For this project to work on your local machine, you will need to have node (https://nodejs.org/en/) and postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed. Do this before following the next steps.

To run this project, start postgres then do the following in your terminal:
  - git clone this project into a directory of your choice
  - move into the project directory: 'cd redux-pain-log'
  - Install the relevant packages: 'npm install'
  - create a database named painLog: 'createdb painLog'
  - start the application: 'npm start'

Then go to your browser, and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

Project usage:
This project is meant to be a notebook of sorts for tracking pain levels over time.
Currently, the profile, login, and sign-up buttons are not functional. They exist purely for decoration at this point in time.
